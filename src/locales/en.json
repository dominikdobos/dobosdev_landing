      {
        "question": "How long does it take to complete my website?",
        "answer": "A landing page takes about 1-2 week, a 3-5 page business website takes 3-4 weeks. This depends on the project's complexity and how quickly we can align on the details. For custom projects, we will agree on a deadline together."
      },
      {
        "question": "How does payment work?",
        "answer": "I start work with a 50% deposit, which must be paid when ordering. The remaining 50% is due upon delivery, before going live. All prices include 2 rounds of revisions; additional requests are billed hourly."
      },
      {
        "question": "What do I need to provide for the website?",
        "answer": "I'll need text content (or I can help write/edit it), a logo, and images/photos of your business. If you don't have everything, I can help gather it or suggest alternatives (e.g., stock photos)."
      },
      {
        "question": "Will I have my own domain and email address?",
        "answer": "Yes! I help with domain (web address) registration and setup, as well as creating email addresses (e.g., info@yourcompany.com). These costs are separate but I handle everything for you."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I edit the site later?",
        "answer": "The website is built with modern technology (React), which requires developer knowledge. Every project includes detailed developer documentation, so you can involve another developer at any time. Of course, I'm always available for any modifications, even small text changes."
      },
      {
        "question": "What does basic SEO include?",
        "answer": "Basic SEO includes setting up meta titles and descriptions, heading structure optimization, Google Analytics and Search Console basic configuration, and website speed optimization. This is the first step to getting your site to appear in search engines."
